    <h1>Taarlo</h1>
    <h3>by Herman de coninck</h3>
    <p>
        I love the slowness of lying on grass, like a king: 
        me, looking out and surveying my adherents, 
        my extremities, telling my left arm: 
        you there, convey my hand to my mouth 
        that I might yawn, that's right, 
        and now lie down again, excellent, 
        I must have discipline. 

        I love the slowness of being, 
        Zen, they say in the East, I believe 
        it's the same thing. 
        ...

    <h1>My way</h1>
    <h3>Frank Sinatra</h3>
    <p>
        And now, the end is near
        And so I face the final curtain
        My friend, I'll say it clear
        I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
        I've lived a life that's full
        I've traveled each and every highway
        But more, much more than this
        I did it my way
        Regrets, I've had a few
        But then again, too few to mention
        I did what I had to do
        And saw it through without exemption
        ...
